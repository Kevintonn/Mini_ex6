Title: Alien symbol generator

The symbol created in the sketch is cut up into 3 "seperate canvases". Each "canvas" has its own set of rules, for how the circles created inside should behave. The rules are semi-randomized so the sketch creates a similar but different symbol each time it is opened.

I don't really know, if i succeeded in creating something akin to generative art. the output of the sketch is too predictable and feels more human created, than computer generated. I had a very hard time making something that felt like generative art/"computer authored" without it being too random or complex for me.
